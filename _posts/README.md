Approximation Algorithm: Implements iterative approximation for square root calculation.
Bisection Method: Searches for roots using interval halving.
Fixed-Point Iteration: Iteratively computes a fixed-point solution.
Newton-Raphson Method: Uses derivative-based updates for root finding.

You can compile this code by opening the assignment_1.py file and compiling through the Python extension.

To be perfectly honest, when trying to route all of the files and folders into my repository, I got really confused and did the best I could to at least have the assignment completed.

Please let me know what I can do to improve for my future assignments as I have never used GitHub before.
